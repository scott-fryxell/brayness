# Quality Checks

Detail behind SKILL.md's output checklist: visual inspect, contrast, design
adherence, and the animation map.

## Visual inspect

`hyperframes inspect` runs the composition in headless Chrome, seeks through
the timeline, and maps visual layout issues with timestamps, selectors,
bounding boxes, and fix hints. Run it after `lint` and `validate`:

```bash
npx hyperframes inspect
npx hyperframes inspect --json
```

Failures usually mean text is spilling out of a bubble/card, a fixed-size
label is clipping dynamic copy, or text has moved off the canvas. Fix by
increasing container size or padding, reducing font size or letter spacing,
adding a real `max-width` so text wraps inside the container, or using
`window.__hyperframes.fitTextFontSize(...)` for dynamic copy.

Use `--samples 15` for dense videos and `--at 1.5,4,7.25` for specific hero
frames. Repeated static issues are collapsed by default to avoid flooding
agent context. If overflow is intentional for an entrance/exit animation,
mark the element or ancestor with `data-layout-allow-overflow`. If a
decorative element should never be audited, mark it with
`data-layout-ignore`.

`hyperframes layout` is the compatibility alias for the same check.

## Contrast

`hyperframes validate` runs a WCAG contrast audit by default. It seeks to 5
timestamps, screenshots the page, samples background pixels behind every
text element, and computes contrast ratios. Failures appear as warnings:

```
⚠ WCAG AA contrast warnings (3):
  · .subtitle "secondary text" - 2.67:1 (need 4.5:1, t=5.3s)
```

If warnings appear:

- On dark backgrounds: brighten the failing color until it clears 4.5:1
  (normal text) or 3:1 (large text, 24px+ or 19px+ bold)
- On light backgrounds: darken it
- Stay within the palette family - don't invent a new color, adjust the
  existing one
- Re-run `hyperframes validate` until clean

Use `--no-contrast` to skip if iterating rapidly and you'll check later.

## Design adherence

If a `design.md` exists, verify the composition follows it after authoring.
Read the HTML and check:

1. **Colors** - every hex value in the composition appears in design.md's
   palette section (however the user labeled it: Colors, Palette, Theme).
   Flag any invented colors.
2. **Typography** - font families and weights match design.md's type spec.
   No substitutions.
3. **Corners** - border-radius values match the declared corner style, if
   specified.
4. **Spacing** - padding and gap values fall within the declared density
   range, if specified.
5. **Depth** - shadow usage matches the declared depth level, if specified
   (flat = none, subtle = light, layered = glows).
6. **Avoidance rules** - if design.md lists things to avoid ("What NOT to
   Do", "Don'ts", "Anti-patterns"), verify none are present.

Report violations as a checklist. Fix each one before serving.

If no `design.md` exists (house-style-only path), verify:

1. **Palette consistency** - the same bg, fg, and accent colors across all
   scenes. No per-scene color invention.
2. **No lazy defaults** - check against house-style.md's "Lazy Defaults to
   Question" list. Any that appear must be a deliberate choice for the
   content, not a default.

## Animation map

After authoring animations, verify choreography:

```bash
node skills/hyperframes/scripts/animation-map.js <composition-dir> \
  --out <composition-dir>/.hyperframes/anim-map
```

Outputs a single `animation-map.json` with:

- **Per-tween summaries**: `"#card1 animates opacity+y over 0.50s. moves 23px up. fades in. ends at (120, 200)"`
- **ASCII timeline**: Gantt chart of all tweens across the composition duration
- **Stagger detection**: reports actual intervals (`"3 elements stagger at 120ms"`)
- **Dead zones**: periods over 1s with no animation - intentional hold or missing entrance?
- **Element lifecycles**: first/last animation time, final visibility
- **Scene snapshots**: visible element state at 5 key timestamps
- **Flags**: `offscreen`, `collision`, `invisible`, `paced-fast` (under 0.2s), `paced-slow` (over 2s)

Read the JSON. Scan summaries for anything unexpected. Check every flag -
fix or justify. Verify the timeline shows the intended choreography rhythm.
Re-run after fixes.

Skip on small edits (fixing a color, adjusting one duration). Run on new
compositions and significant animation changes.
